# Backend APIs

This project hosts a few list of mock APIs, that are containerized and ready for deployment in kubernetes on local or cloud.

The APIs are cloud native by design.

1. APIs produce metrics for monitoring
2. APIs store logs on the local filesystem, so a volume can be mounted on kubernetes or docker host.
3. Container-ized for Cloud Native
4. Written in Python Fast API & Node.js Nest Framework for Diversification.
